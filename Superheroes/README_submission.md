#  PAW Coding Task - Submission notes

This README contains additional explanatory notes relating to the PAW "Superhero" coding task.  

1. Ordinarily the code would be pragmatically minimal, and any in-code documentation would be focussed at a competent developer level, with an assumption that
code had undergone review for clarity and correctness.  In the absence of (immediate) review and explanatory pull request notes I've opted to add additional commentary
in-line in the code.  These comments may be seen as overkill and I'd bed the reviewer's understanding.

2. - "Keep history of requests/responses and allow to switch between them;" - This is ambiguous. Ordinarily I'd seek clarity, but given the scope of the exercise my 
interpretation is that we should be able to switch between different historical requests, not that we should be able to switch between the request and response.
